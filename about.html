<h1>About Me</h1>
<br>
<h2> Summary </h2>
<p> I'm from Detroit,Mi and my interests are technology,  chess , sports , music and most of all traveling. My mother being originally from another country meant that I was fortunate enough to travel at a very young age to visit family, I was able to see places such as London , Italy , Spain , and most recently Dubai and Africa. Which I believe is what inititally sparked my interest in technology from seeing how it has the capabilty to bring people together from all over the world.
