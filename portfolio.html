<h3> My Favorite 3 Labs </h3>

<ol>
<li>LAB-17PrimeNumberFinder - this was a enjoyable lab for me , I got to utilize the Test Driven Development strategy to make a console app that based on a number from user input it will tell you the prime number in a sequence of primes. along with sequence number entered.  <a href = "https://github.com/jamesgooden/Lab17PrimeNumberFinder/blob/master/src/LocatePrimeNum.java">click me</a></li>


<li>LibraryTerminal Midterm Project - In this lab I worked in a group and really liked the outcome of the project. I think we all did a great of putting this together. I found working on the search method to play a big part in helping me better understand arraylists , foreach loops , classes , and objects.  <a href = "https://github.com/GaleHenderson/MidTermProject-Library">click me</a></li>
